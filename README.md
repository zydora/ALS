## ALS
ALS instead BP on mnist. The architecture is three layer neural network with relu or sigmoid activate function.

## dataset
"dataset" file should be unzipped, should be put into the same profile with codes.\
"dataset" just contain MNIST, for SVHN, should be downloaded for "test_32x32.mat" and "train_32x32.mat" from official web.\

For CIFAR, should download "cifar-10-matlab.tar.gz" from web. \

## Matrix completion
mc function refers https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26395-matrix-completion-via-thresholding
several toolboxes should be downloaded and set first, refer to the procedure of "demo" from the link.

## test
run "demo_als_matrix", "index" for adjusting activation function, "mc" for adjusting matrix completion function.
